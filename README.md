Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the best solution of a given problem. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate the best solution in a large search space. It is often used when the search space is discrete ( [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing "Wikipedia"))

This repository contains two modules:
- findMinimum
- tsp

Module findMinimum uses Simulated Annealing to approximate the minimum of $f(x) = (x-0.3)^3 - 5x + x^2 - 2$.
The source code of this module is documented to get a basic understanding of Simulated Annealing algorithm.

Module tsp uses Simulated Annealing to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
